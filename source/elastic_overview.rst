Elasticsearch Overview
=======================

What is Elasticsearch?
----------------------

Elasticsearch is `a distributed, open source search and analytics engine <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_preface.html>`_ designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and easy management. Elasticsearch combines speed and power: it unites search and analytics through a sophisticated, developer-friendly query language that covers structured, unstructured, and time-series data.
