Getting Started Guide
=====================

This guide is designed to get you setup with an ObjectRocket account and on your way to creating instances with us! There are just a few steps necessary, and they're outlined below. Follow along by using our `Sign Up <https://app.objectrocket.com/sign_up>`_ page!

1. Create an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obtaining an ObjectRocket account is as simple as `signing up here <https://app.objectrocket.com/sign_up>`_ and completing the forms listed. Enter your account information, all fields are required. ObjectRocket utilizes a single login for now, but we're working on adding functionality for sub-accounts. For now we recommend using a mailing list if you need access for multiple people, eg. devops\@mycompany.com.

Once filled in, click *Launch my account*.

2. Add billing info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can create an instance, you'll need to add your billing information. You can do so from the default landing page by clicking *add a credit card to your account*, or by clicking your username on the upper right, clicking *Billing Information*, then clicking the *Set Credit Card* button on the left side.

3. Create an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we offer MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch, there are guides for getting started with each: 

- :doc:`mongodb_getting_started` 

- :doc:`redis_getting_started`

- :doc:`elastic_getting_started`
