Getting Started Guide
=====================

This guide helps you get started quickly and easily on the ObjectRocket platform. Follow along on the `Sign Up <https://app.objectrocket.com/sign_up>`_ page!

1. Create an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Sign up for ObjectRocket here <https://app.objectrocket.com/sign_up>`_. Enter your account information (all fields required) and click *Launch my account*.

ObjectRocket utilizes a single login for now, but we're working on adding functionality for sub-accounts. For now we recommend entering a mailing list address if you need access for multiple people. For example: `devops@mycompany.com`.

Click *Launch my account* to continue.

2. Add billing information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click *Add Credit Card* on the `default landing page <https://app.objectrocket.com/instances/>`_, or click your username on the upper right, click *Billing Information*, then click *Set Credit Card*.

3. Create an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
