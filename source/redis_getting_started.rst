Getting Started with Redis
==========================

1. Create an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 1
------

#. Click the Instance heading, then click on *Add Instance*.

#. Enter a name for your instance. 

    This can be almost anything, as any alpha numeric string is valid.

#. Select Redis for the service.

    The type defaults to HA Redis.

Click on *Step 2* to continue.

Step 2
------

#. Select a version to deploy.

    ObjectRocket offers versions 2.8 and 3.0.

#. Select a zone.

    Zones are Rackspace and/or AWS Direct Connect zones, labeled by airport codes in that region. Check out the `zone map <http://objectrocket.com/features>`_ for more details.

#. Select a plan that suits your needs. 

    For more details, check out `plans and pricing <http://objectrocket.com/pricing>`_.

Click on *Confirm* to review your entries, then click *Create*. Your new instance is ready!

2. Add an Access Control List (ACL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Access Control Lists (ACL) limit who connects to your instance. 

.. note::

    ObjectRocket denies access by default. Add an ACL for any server that connects to the instance.

#. In the Security section of the instance details page, click *Add ACL*. 

#. Enter an IP address/CIDR block and a description.

    Only the IP address is mandatory, but descriptions can help when maintaining larger lists.

#. Click *Add ACL Entry*.

3. Connect!
~~~~~~~~~~~

After you've created a database with user authentication and added an ACL, you're ready to test basic connectivity in a terminal session with redis-cli::

   $ redis-cli -h '<hostname>' -p '<port>' -a '<password>'
   hostname:port> set my_key my_value
   OK
   hostname:port> get my_key
   "my_value"

You can also connect with netcat/telnet::

   $ nc '<hostname>' '<port>'
   auth <password>
   +OK
   set my_key my_value
   +OK
   get my_key
   $8
   my_value

If you see similar results, you're connected to the instance and can perform database operations. Success!
